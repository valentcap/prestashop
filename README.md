# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# How to deploy PrestaShop in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami PrestaShop Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/upstreamed/prestashop).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 8 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 9 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 8.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) >= `1.10.0`. [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose) is recommended with a version `1.6.0` or later.

## Run PrestaShop with a Database Container

Running PrestaShop with a database server is the recommended way. You can either use docker-compose or run the containers manually.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

This is the recommended way to run PrestaShop. You can use the following docker compose template:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_USER=bn_prestashop
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_prestashop
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami'
  prestashop:
    image: 'bitnami/prestashop:latest'
    environment:
      - MARIADB_HOST=mariadb
      - MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - 'prestashop_data:/bitnami'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  prestashop_data:
    driver: local
```

### Run the application manually

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```bash
  $ docker network create prestashop-tier
  ```

2. Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

  ```bash
  $ docker volume create --name mariadb_data
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e MARIADB_USER=bn_prestashop \
    -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_prestashop \
    --net prestashop-tier \
    --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami \
    bitnami/mariadb:latest
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to PrestaShop to resolve the host

3. Create volumes for Prestashop persistence and launch the container

  ```bash
  $ docker volume create --name prestashop_data
  $ docker run -d --name prestashop -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop \
    -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop \
    --net prestashop-tier \
    --volume prestashop_data:/bitnami \
    bitnami/prestashop:latest
  ```

Then you can access your application at <http://your-ip/>

  *Note:* If you want to access your application from a public IP or hostname you need to configure PrestaShop for it. You can handle it adjusting the configuration of the instance by setting the environment variable "PRESTASHOP_HOST" to your public IP or hostname.

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a volume at the `/bitnami` path. Additionally you should mount a volume for [persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define docker volumes namely `mariadb_data` and `prestashop_data`. The PrestaShop application state will persist as long as these volumes are not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of these volumes you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the `docker-compose.yml` template previously shown:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_USER=bn_prestashop
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_prestashop
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami'
  prestashop:
    image: 'bitnami/prestashop:latest'
    environment:
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/prestashop-persistence:/bitnami'
   depends_on:
      - mariadb
```

### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. Create a network (if it does not exist):

  ```bash
  $ docker network create prestashop-tier
  ```

2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e MARIADB_USER=bn_prestashop \
    -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_prestashop \
    --network prestashop-tier \
    --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/mariadb:latest
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to PrestaShop to resolve the host

3. Run the PrestaShop container:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name prestashop -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop \
    -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop \
    --network prestashop-tier \
    --volume /path/to/prestashop-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/prestashop:latest
  ```

# Upgrading PrestaShop

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and PrestaShop, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the PrestaShop container. For the MariaDB upgrade see https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

1. Get the updated images:

  ```bash
  $ docker pull bitnami/prestashop:latest
  ```

2. Stop your container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop prestashop`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker stop prestashop`

3. Take a snapshot of the application state

```bash
$ rsync -a /path/to/prestashop-persistence /path/to/prestashop-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

Additionally, [snapshot the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#step-2-stop-and-backup-the-currently-running-container)

You can use these snapshots to restore the application state should the upgrade fail.

4. Remove the currently running container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm -v prestashop`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker rm -v prestashop`

5. Run the new image

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose up prestashop`
 * For manual execution ([mount](#mount-persistent-folders-manually) the directories if needed): `docker run --name prestashop bitnami/prestashop:latest`

# Configuration

## Environment variables

When you start the PrestaShop image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the docker run command line.

  ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
  environment:
    - PRESTASHOP_HOST=your_host
  volumes:
    - prestashop_data:/bitnami
```

 * For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name prestashop -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  --network prestashop-tier \
  --e PRESTASHOP_PASSWORD=my_password \
  --volume /path/to/prestashop-persistence:/bitnami \

  -e MARIADB_HOST=mariadb \
  -e MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306 \
  -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop \
  -e PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop \
  -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
  -e SMTP_PORT=587 \
  -e SMTP_PROTOCOL=tls \
  -e SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
  -e SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password \
  --network prestashop-tier \
  --volume /path/to/prestashop-persistence:/bitnami \
  bitnami/prestashop:latest
```

# Troubleshooting

* If you are automatically logged out from the administration panel, you can try deploying PrestaShop with the environment variable `PRESTASHOP_COOKIE_CHECK_IP=no`

# Customize this image

The Bitnami PrestaShop Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

## Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

- Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the ports used by Apache for HTTP and HTTPS, by setting the environment variables `APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER` and `APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER` respectively.
- [Adding custom virtual hosts](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#adding-custom-virtual-hosts).
- [Replacing the 'httpd.conf' file](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#full-configuration).
- [Using custom SSL certificates](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/prestashop
## Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

- Install the `vim` editor
- Modify the Apache configuration file
- Modify the ports used by Apache

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/prestashop
LABEL maintainer "Bitnami <containers@bitnami.com>"

## Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim

## Enable mod_ratelimit module
RUN sed -i -r 's/#LoadModule ratelimit_module/LoadModule ratelimit_module/' /opt/bitnami/apache/conf/httpd.conf

## Modify the ports used by Apache by default
# It is also possible to change these environment variables at runtime
ENV APACHE_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181 
ENV APACHE_HTTPS_PORT_NUMBER=8143
EXPOSE 8181 8143
```

Based on the extended image, you can use a Docker Compose file like the one below to add other features:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:10.1'
    environment:
      - MARIADB_USER=bn_prestashop
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_prestashop
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami'
  prestashop:
    build: .
    environment:
      - MARIADB_HOST=mariadb
      - MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - PRESTASHOP_HOST=localhost
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_USER=bn_prestashop
      - PRESTASHOP_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_prestashop
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    ports:
      - '80:8181'
      - '443:8143'
    volumes:
      - 'prestashop_data:/bitnami'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  prestashop_data:
    driver: local
```

# Notable Changes

## 1.7.5-2-debian-9-r12 and 1.7.5-2-ol-7-r18

- This image has been adapted so it's easier to customize. See the [Customize this image](#customize-this-image) section for more information.
- The Apache configuration volume (`/bitnami/apache`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the Apache configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom Apache configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/apache/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- The PHP configuration volume (`/bitnami/php`) has been deprecated, and support for this feature will be dropped in the near future. Until then, the container will enable the PHP configuration from that volume if it exists. By default, and if the configuration volume does not exist, the configuration files will be regenerated each time the container is created. Users wanting to apply custom PHP configuration files are advised to mount a volume for the configuration at `/opt/bitnami/php/conf`, or mount specific configuration files individually.
- Enabling custom Apache certificates by placing them at `/opt/bitnami/apache/certs` has been deprecated, and support for this functionality will be dropped in the near future. Users wanting to enable custom certificates are advised to mount their certificate files on top of the preconfigured ones at `/certs`.
